# custom_components
Custom components I've created for home assistant (hopefully that will be submitted live eventually)
based on keytontaylors work i added the option to play Flashbriefing, joke etc...

This is very dirty made since i know *nothing* of programming python!!

This means i cant support on errors. But this component works for me!!
**So use it at your own risk!!**
